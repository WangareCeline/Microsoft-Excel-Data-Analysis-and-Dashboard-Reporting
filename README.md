# Microsoft-Excel-Data-Analysis-and-Dashboard-Reporting
This excel sheet allows the user to select a customer name and view data about it presented in tables and a chart. 
The user can control what data is shown on the chart by specifying the order month.

The data shown on the dashboard is protected, therefore, the user cannot select locked cells or modify them.
In case you want to edit the file you must first unprotect the sheet.
To modify the worksheet: 
                        1) Go to the review tab.
                        2) Click on 'unprotect sheet'.
                        3) Type in the password which is 'unprotectSheet' (be sure to get it right because it is case sensitive).
                        4) Click OK.

After following the steps, you can freely modify the excel sheet but be sure to protect the worksheet after you are done so that your work will be protected from unauthorized modification.
